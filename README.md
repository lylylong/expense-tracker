# Expense Tracker

## Description

This Expense Tracker app is a very useful tool for travelers who want to track account balance when they are traveling. It's possible to track their withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection.

Let's see how this app works, it provides the following functionality:

- When a user enters expenses/deposits online, the entries will be added to the tracker immediately.

- When a user enters expenses/deposits offline, the entries will be stored in the indexedDB, and will be send to the server when the internet comes back. Offline entries will be added to the tracker when the application is brought back online.
